		<h1>Why I Love the Coaster</h1>

		<p>On the majority of days, I take the Coaster from Carlsbad to Old Town.  This is very convenient for a lot of different reasons such as:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>generally on time departure and arrival</li>
			<li>no traffic</li>
			<li>free wifi (although not reliable)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>While those things are all great, here are the top 3 reasons why YOU should consider taking the Coaster too</p>

		<ol>
			<li>people watching</li>
			<li>friendly conductors</li>
			<li>fantastic views
		</ol>

		<p>So, next time you need to get from North County to South or vice versa, hop on the Coaster!</p>
